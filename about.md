# A little about us...
We are the Nepal ANANDA club from University of Mary Washington which is located in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

### Going forward...
<ul>
<li>NAC is dedicated to working with the Fredericksburg and Nepali communities to spread cultural awareness and aid Nepal-based service organizations.</li>
<li>Our primary goal is to help Sagarmatha Children Home, it is an orphanage with 19 children living. The maximum amount to monthly sponsor a child is 150$ and our goal is to sponsor all of them.</li>
<li>We are also supported by the sister city of Fredericksburg and Kathmandu, and will further assist in any upcoming events done by the sister city.</li>
</ul>
